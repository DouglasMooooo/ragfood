**Project:** Cloud RAG Migration

## 1. Current Status

This document records the actual progress of migrating the local Week 2 RAG system (ChromaDB + Ollama) to a cloud setup using Upstash Vector Database and Groq Cloud API.

As of now, environment configuration and initial SDK integration have been completed.  
Functional RAG workflow is **not yet operational** due to Groq not supporting embedding generation.

---

## 2. What Has Been Completed

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | `.env` file created with valid credentials | ✅ Done |
| 2 | `upstash-vector`, `groq`, and `openai` packages installed | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Python 3.13 environment verified | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Upstash Vector index created and connected successfully | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Groq API key verified (LLM response working) | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Local test of data upload and query executed | ⚠️ Partial success |
| 7 | Embedding step failed (Groq API unsupported) | ❌ Blocked |

---

## 3. Problem Summary 

### 3.1 Technical Limitation
Groq Cloud currently provides **text generation only** (e.g., `llama3-8b`, `mixtral-8x7b`),  
and **does not offer any embedding model** such as `text-embedding-3-small`.

The assignment requirement expects Upstash to use Groq for embedding,  
but technically this **cannot be done** through the current Groq API.  
All embedding-related endpoints return:


##  Environment Variables Configuration

Configured via `.env` file at project root:

```bash
# Never commit real secrets. Use placeholders here and store real values only in .env
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="<your_upstash_write_token>"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_READONLY_TOKEN="<your_upstash_readonly_token>"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="<your_upstash_vector_rest_url>"
GROQ_API_KEY="<your_groq_api_key>"
OPENAI_API_KEY="<optional_openai_api_key>"

## 4. Workaround Attempted

| Attempt | Description | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| A | Generate embeddings locally (Ollama) then upload vectors | Not aligned with “cloud-only” requirement |
| B | Use Upstash built-in embedding model (mxbai-embed-large-v1) | Works in dashboard, not exposed via Python SDK |
| C | Switch to OpenAI API for embedding | Works, but blocked by account quota |
| D | Use fake placeholder vectors for testing | Query runs but semantic matching invalid |

Conclusion: Upstash and Groq integration is **set up correctly**,  
but the **embedding source** remains the missing component.

## 5. Current System Architecture 
User Query
↓
Groq LLM (for text generation)
↓
Upstash Vector (for vector storage)
↓
Food dataset (foods.json)
### Observations:
- Upstash connection and upsert logic confirmed working.
- Groq LLM responds correctly to textual prompts.
- Semantic search fails because no valid embeddings are stored.

## 6. Key Errors Encountered

| # | Error | Cause | Resolution |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `query() got unexpected keyword argument` | Old SDK | Upgraded to 0.8.1 |
| 2 | `QueryResult object has no attribute 'get'` | SDK interface change | Adjusted query parser |
| 3 | No results found | Missing embedding vectors | Identified root cause |
| 4 | `text-embedding-3-small` not supported | Groq lacks embedding endpoint | Switched to OpenAI |
| 5 | `insufficient_quota` | OpenAI free tier exhausted | Requires paid API |
| 6 | `AttributeError: Index.url` | Deprecated attribute | Removed from print line |

---

## 7. Verified Working Components

| Component | Functionality | Status |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Upstash Vector connection | ✅ Works |
| Data upload (`index.upsert`) | ✅ Works |
| Groq LLM chat API | ✅ Works |
| Environment variables | ✅ Works |
| Embedding generation | ❌ Not supported on Groq |
| Query with semantic context | ❌ Not functional yet |

---

## 8. Next Realistic Steps

1. Keep the current cloud structure (Upstash + Groq).
2. Use **OpenAI or HuggingFace** embeddings temporarily to complete migration.  
   - If OpenAI billing is added → continue embedding via `text-embedding-3-small`.  
   - If local embedding allowed → use `sentence-transformers` as fallback.  
3. Document that **Groq cannot perform embeddings as of October 2025**.  
4. Add note in final README that full semantic retrieval requires external embedding API.

---

## 9. Summary (真实结论)

- Migration infrastructure is complete and verified.  
- RAG workflow is **partially operational** (data upload + LLM response).  
- The blocking issue is **embedding generation**, as Groq does not provide that capability.  
- All remaining features depend on using a secondary embedding provider (OpenAI or HuggingFace).  

The current build meets **50–60% of migration goals**, covering all infrastructure setup and SDK migration, but not full semantic search functionality.

---

## 10. Evidence Captured

- `.env` configured with valid tokens  
- Successful connection printout:  

- Error screenshots: `429 insufficient_quota`, `model not found` (stored in /screenshots/)
- Confirmed Groq key functional via chat test

## 11. Notes for Instructor
> This submission reflects the real current state of the migration.  
> Groq’s lack of embedding API prevents full cloud RAG completion.  
> All other components (Upstash DB, API auth, Groq LLM, code migration)  
> are verified and functioning correctly.
